Conversely, suppose the intersection of a set with any line is convex, take any two distinctive points from the set, the intersection of the set with the line through the two points is convex. Therefore the convex combination of the two points belongs to the intersection and also belongs to the set. Hence the set is convex. The second part about affinity can be proved similarly."
